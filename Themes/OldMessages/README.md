## Notes
* **Discord > Setting > Appearance > Chat font scaling** - Set to 15px on preview image above. Setting itself is working correctly.
* **Discord > Setting > Appearance > Space between message groups** - Isn't working yet, maybe I'll add it later. I'm sowwy.
* **Message posted date / (edited) text** - scaled from .85rem to 1rem. As it was before some update in 2019 or 2018, idk.
